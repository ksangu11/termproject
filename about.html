                        <h1>About</h1><br>
                        <p>I am a current student at <a href=http://www.bu.edu>Boston University</a> 
                            in pursuit of a Masters degree in Computer Information Systems with a 
                            concentration in Web Application Development. I completed my
                            Bachelors degree in Information Technology in 2019. Prior to diving
                            into technology I have a background in graphic and fine art. For the past 
                            five years I have worked for a small cleaning service where I handle all things 
                            'tech'. Some of my responsibilities include purchasing recommendations, database management, 
                            CRM management, social media and email marketing, and the design and 
                            maintenance of the company website. This is the current version of the
                            <a href=http://www.mcguirescleaning.com>McGuire's Cleaning Service</a> website.
                            It is my hope in the near future to extend these skills into opening 
                            my own development business.</p><br>
                        <p>As a child of the MySpace-era I have decent familiarity with
                            HTML/CSS concepts. In my formal web design projects I have predominately used
                            WordPress for its ability to easily administer various user roles, as well 
                            as the extensive open source plugin availbility. Aside from web design, 
                            I really enjoy working in relational databases. Some other languages I am also 
                            familiar with include Python and SQL. See below for a complete list

                                he is quite happy to finally have his own yard.
